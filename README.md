# CleanDesktop

Clean Desktop is a script that allows people a quick and easy way to organise there messy folders
Common examples of folders that get messy are Desktops, Documents, Cloud Drives and Downloads folders


To Use
Just drop the script into a directory/folder that you want organising and run the script.
It will sort all your files and documents in to organised sub folders

The folders that the files will go into is dependent on there file extension
or in the case of apps and shortcuts it will organise them in to category's based on the app

The current setup is an example. However if you want it to change how it sorts the folders and what folders it creates
instructions are in the script itself however the jist of it is: 

You can simpley manipulate the arrays just change what folder the extentions or apps go into.
Apps are sorted by keyword in there names.


Also Now supports Hybrid Directory's (directory's that are made up of two or more other directory's) like desktop
But you will have to populate the Hybrid Array yourself. It has Desktop there as a example
